Day 1 of 50 Days of Code Challenge

Expandable Card with React and Framer Motion

Overview
This project marks Day 1 of my "50 Days of Code" challenge, where I'll be building and learning something new every day. Today, I created a simple expandable card using React and Framer Motion. This README provides an overview of the project and its features.

Project Features
Expandable Card: A visually appealing card that can be expanded or collapsed with smooth animations.
Built with React: Utilized the React library for building the user interface.
Framer Motion Animations: Employed Framer Motion to add fluid animations to the card's expansion and collapse.
Interactive Design: Users can click on the card to expand it, revealing additional content, and click again to collapse it.
Responsive: Designed to work seamlessly on different screen sizes.
