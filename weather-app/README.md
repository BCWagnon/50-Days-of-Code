# Day 5/50 of my 50-Day JavaScript Coding Challenge! üå§Ô∏è

Today was an exhilarating coding day, filled with twists and turns. I took on the challenge of building a weather app by following a fantastic tutorial on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-react-by-building-a-weather-app/). The road was a bit bumpy; I encountered some struggles with three different apps, two of which didn't quite work as expected. However, amidst the challenges, I emerged victorious with this weather app, and the learning experience was worth every struggle.

Let's dive into the highs and lows of today's coding adventure! ‚òÅÔ∏èüßë‚Äçüíª

## What I Learned

- **Null Checks:** Today, I gained a deep understanding of null checks and their significance in programming. Knowing when and where to perform null checks is crucial, especially when dealing with external data sources or user inputs.

## Project Details

- **Weather App:** Built a weather app using React, following a tutorial by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-react-by-building-a-weather-app/). The app now provides weather information seamlessly.

## Getting Started

If you're curious about how I tackled this weather app challenge or want to explore the code, you can check out the project folder for Day 5. Inside, you'll find the code and any additional resources or instructions.

Feel free to tinker with the code, experiment, and use it as a learning resource for your own weather app projects.
