# Day 4/50 of my 50-Day JavaScript Coding Challenge! ðŸŒŸ

Today was all about diving into the core concepts of React: passing data through props and setting state. These are the building blocks that allow us to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

## What I Learned

- **Passing Data Through Props:** I learned how to pass data from a parent component to a child component using props. This enables the sharing of information between different parts of the application.

- **Setting State:** I explored the concept of state in React. State allows us to manage and update data within a component, leading to dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

## Tutorial Link

I followed a fantastic tutorial to reinforce these concepts. Check it out here: [React Official Tutorial - Tic-Tac-Toe](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe).

## Getting Started

If you're interested in exploring the code or the exercises I worked on today, you can check out the project folder. Inside, you'll find the code snippets and any additional resources or instructions.

Feel free to experiment with the code, create your own examples, and solidify your understanding of props and state in React.
